    <h4 style="text-align: center;" id="changefont">With the exception of the bulbous plants which i have named, the
        plants used here are very easily propagated. This is a<br>
        great advantage because from their nature, and the time for planting them in their winter quarters, they are not
        adapted<br>
        for long jouneys by rail and as they must be used in large masses in order to get a good effect, they would
        prove expensive<br>
        if purchased; like all other operations in horticulture, there is a risk of failure, unless certain rules are
        followed.<br>
        I will briefly indicate the system of propagation followed here, and to prevent repetition will divide the list
        previosuly<br>
        given into six classes...</h4>
